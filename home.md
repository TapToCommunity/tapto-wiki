TapTo is an open source system for launching games and scripted actions using physical objects like NFC cards. It's a great way to make playing games more accessible and add some fun to your gaming setup!

See the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section below for everything you need to get up and running. Additional hardware is required but is aimed to be cheap and easily available. Please [join the Discord](https://wizzo.dev/discord) if you need any help or want to show off your work!

## Getting Started

1. Buy or build a compatible NFC reader: [Reader Hardware](docs/readers.md)
2. Buy some compatible NFC cards or tags: [Token Hardware](docs/tokens.md)
3. Set up the software for your platform: [MiSTer FPGA](docs/mister.md) | [Commodore 64](https://github.com/SensoriumEmbedded/TeensyROM/blob/main/docs/NFC_Loader.md)

# Does TapTo support NeoGeo games on MiSTer?

Yes, partially. For the best experience, use games in the [.neo file format](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/NeoGeo_MiSTer#features) which is fully supported by TapTo's game search functions and launching from a token.

TapTo currently also supports *launching* .zip and folder format games, but not looking them up via search. For example, you can use these formats by writing the text to a token: `NeoGeo/mslug` or `NeoGeo/mslug2.zip`
